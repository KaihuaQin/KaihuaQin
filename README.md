### Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Ph.D. student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), supervised by [Dr. Arthur Gervais](https://arthurgervais.com/).
My research interests span blockchains and system security with a recent focus on decentralized finance (DeFi).
DeFi is one of the most promising applications of blockchains.
I'm motivated to understand the risks and vulnerabilities of the DeFi ecosystem.
Many of the DeFi security issues are caused by the inherent properties of blockchains and flawed protocol designs.
In my research, I'm trying to improve the security of DeFi from both the underlying blockchain and the high-level DeFi protocol perspective.

Check out my [personal page](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) if you are interested.
